accept-integer-input-part-two
============================

two variables, ask for user input, accept integers only and then print result

So based on the previous program to accept integer input, this method  asks the user for input, and then prints out the result. The user has a predefined number of attempts to inout an integer.

Critical to set the initial value to NIL and not ZERO.
